## Description
```
Full stack application for tracking expenses over time. Every instance of income or expense is logged by the user, and the data is then represented on the chart for easy visualization of total income over time. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the client side. On the backend, the application uses Express for the server, Mongoose for the ODM, and MongoDB for the database.

In addition, this is a progressive web application that the user can download to their desktop to use locally. The application is also able to function offline through the use of IndexedDB as a temporary database until network connection is reestablished to post the pending data to the Mongo database.
